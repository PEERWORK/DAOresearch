We should do research on what it mean to not have a legal entity

Generally it would mean that people formed a unlimited partnership, but what if they are from different countries
    -Raquel: We should avoid DAOs to be formed as unlimited entity, mainly because the difference between limited and unlimited is that in an unlimited if there is a debt, you have to face it also with your personal property to cover it.

International law can acctually accept DAOs as no-residential entities if they have the paperwork done right
