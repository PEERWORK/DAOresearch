Warning when joining DAO


DAOs have risks!

Welcome to Upstream DAOs! In order to participate in a DAO, you must acknowledge and specifically agree to each of the following individual terms:

DAOs are not to be utilized for investment purposes, nor are they intended to be used for the purchase of financial products. You may not use a DAO to conduct any activity which is illegal in your jurisdiction.
Funds contributed to a DAO will be collectively held by the DAO in a multi-signature, non-custodial wallet, and not by Upstream. Upstream does not have the power to refund any funds contributed to a DAO.
Cryptocurrency is largely unregulated and inherently risky. Participation in a DAO is at your own risk. Upstream is not responsible for any losses you may incur, including, but not limited to, those resulting from the actions of other users in the DAO.
The DAO, and not Upstream or any one individual, makes decisions on behalf of the group. Accordingly, the DAO may make decisions made that you do not agree with, which can result in a lack of liquidity or the loss of your digital assets. You will be bound by such decisions, even if you disagree with them. Before contributing any funds, you are responsible for making sure you understand the technology utilized by the DAO and associated risks.
You are waiving your rights to assert a claim against Upstream in a court of law in front of a judge and/or jury. Any disputes you have with Upstream can only be resolved through binding arbitration on an individual basis.
I understand
