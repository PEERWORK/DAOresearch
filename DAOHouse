For Web3 developers who are frustrated building a complicated stack, DAOhaus V3 is a set of resources allowing you to focus on creating value for your community. Unlike spending months wiring up the backend, we have assembled a Decentralized Infrastructure and Software Development Kit to bootstrap DAO applications.

## Software Development Kit
Decentralized Infrastructure
Whether you are building a stand alone project or extending DAOhaus(opens in a new tab) functionality, DAO Toolbox makes it easier to read and write DAO data. We are hoping our years of experience figuring this stuff out saves you time and helps you prioiritize what matters.

The contracts write directly to the blockchain, with subgraphs making the data easier to query. We hope this set of utilities pulling from that base layer makes it more accessible for applications built on top.

We have published the packages in our SDK to NPM. These include the Common Utilities helpers used throughout the different libraries and the Contract Utilities for making function calls and writing data to the contracts. Querying is simplified with the DAO Data library wrapping the subgraphs. Additionally, we have included our component library in the UI package and added some slick builders for common features to help you build DAO apps faster.

These tools are our gift to the Ethereum ecosystem. DAOs are hard. We have spent years meditating, building, failing and iterating on the process and tools for slaying Moloch(opens in a new tab). As a community we can become stronger and encourage you to contribute to this project. Please report bugs, request features and provide feedback to help improve this DAO Toolbox. Everything here is open-source. The software development kit and decentralized infrastructure is in the daohaus-monorepo(opens in a new tab) and the documentation is in the sdk-docs(opens in a new tab) repo on GitHub.
