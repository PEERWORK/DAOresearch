# FEEDBACK 

The solution with a focus on startups makes sense; the process of establishing an entity needs to be simplified.
Also, most of the DAO tools focus on large communities, which doesn't make sense for most organizations.

## Regulatory compliance 
1. Its important to figure out compliance with grants systems so "PEERUP" organization can receive grants and not have issues with compliance

2. At some point, it makes sense to incorporate, and it would be good to enable this through the app (legal zoom, atlas) 

3. consider what jurisdictions to support; some of the tax heaven might make it more complicated to get funding, and if we want to legitimize the industry, we should also be able to incorporate it in major markets. 
Overall, investors might want to have some legal clarity when giving funds

## Accounting
1. For any organization is essential to have accounting for onchain and offchain stuff; they need to pay taxes and just have a good view of their financials.
    Consider integration with QuickBooks

## Business model
1. How much users would be willing to pay for this?
